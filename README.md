# jet-fighter-ai
I'm trying to code a neural-network-based ai evolving with the concept of natural selection and self-play for the game jet fighter.

I will be coding this from the ground up, i.e. not using any ai-libraries, for learning purposes. The first version is in python and the final version will be rewritten in a faster language.
